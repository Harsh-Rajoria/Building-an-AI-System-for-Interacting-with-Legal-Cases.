# Building-an-AI-System-for-Interacting-with-Legal-Cases.

Introduction :- 

So, this project focuses on developing "LexPilot," or 
“Legal- Assistant” an AI-powered co-pilot designed to streamline document management and case file handling at LexAdvise, a leading legal consultancy in Mumbai. Legal professionals often face the challenge of managing large volumes of information, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. LexPilot aims to address this by automating document analysis, facilitating faster research, and offering intelligent insights. The goal is to enhance efficiency, reduce manual effort, and empower lawyers to provide quicker and more informed services to clients. This report outlines the objectives, technical approach, and expected impact of the LexPilot project.
